                demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the
                pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty

                are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled
                and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and
                every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of
                business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise
                man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to
                secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."</p>
